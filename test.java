3.generalized class & special class
generalized classes are declared by developers
special classes are already declared magical packages

4.
A-->by declaring class as private
B-->String class
C-->association

5.
Comparable and Comparator

6.
ArrayList
1.it is index based
2.fast to assesing values
3.modification is easy and fast while compiling

LinkedList
1.it is Node based
2.every node holds address of previous data and next data
3.modification is bit slow comparing with array list

7.iterator and ListIterator

List :
Iterator:
iterator is an inteface 
In list we can access only from 0th index and we can do only remove operation in iterator

listIteraror 
 
in listIteraror we can access& modify the data through any index

10.
static polymorphism 
it's achieved by methodOverloading
methodOverloading means same methods with vary in parameter variables
and sequence of parameter should be change

dynamic polymorphism
it's achieved by method overriding through inheritance
method overriding means subClass overrides the parent members 

11. by achieving encapsulation 
declaring properties has private and declare a getter and setters
